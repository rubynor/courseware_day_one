Create a method grow(numbers) that takes an array of integers, 
and returns a corresponding array where each element is multiplied by 100.
Example: 
grow([3, 4, 6, 3, 5, 6, 12])   => [300, 400, 600, 300, 500, 600, 1200]


BONUS: Create a similar method a_lucky_few(items, x, y). 
It returns the item number x to item number y, and every item in between them. 
Multiply these items by 100. Return the ones that were multiplied, discard the rest.

a_lucky_few([3, 4, 6, 3, 5, 6, 12], 2, 4)   => [600, 300, 500]
