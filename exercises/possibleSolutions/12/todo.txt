Implement RubyKurs::Tree, a namespaced implementation of a basic tree
structure. Each tree node should be initialized with a value, and have
an array of children.

The api should look roughly like this:

tree_node = RubyKurs::Tree.new("parent")
puts tree_node.value # => parent
child1 = RubyKurs::Tree.new("child1")
child2 = RubyKurs::Tree.new("child2")
tree_node.add(child1)
tree_node.add(child2)


Then give it all the standard iterator methods by creating and each()
method mixing the Enumerable module into the class. Verify that the
following enumeration methods then work on the tree:

count
map
find_all
any?

HINT: You can declare that a method expects a block like this:

def foo(&block)
   # ...
end

The block can then be called explicitly like this:
block.call(345)

Using the method foo would then look like this:
foo { |number| puts number} # => 345


BONUS 1: Think about, or discuss with partner: why does the Enumerable
module only mix in non-destructive methods?

BONUS 2: Implement a to_s method which outputs the tree as a string,
like this:

parent.to_s # => parent
            # =>   child1
            # =>     grandchild1
            # =>     grandchild2
            # =>   child2
