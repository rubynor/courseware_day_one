Implement RubyKurs:Tree, a namespaced implementation of a basic tree
structure. Each Tree object api should support methods add(child), parent_node(),
children_nodes(), is_leaf?

Give it all the standard iterator methods by
mixing Enumerable into it. Verify that map, find_all and any? methods
work.

BONUS: Think about, or discuss with partner: why does the Enumerable
module only mix in non-destructive methods?
