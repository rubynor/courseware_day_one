Create a method recursive_xml_extension_to_txt(dir) which for a given
directory finds all the *.xml files within all its subfolders, and for
each of them renames them from *.xml to *.txt

CAUTION! Don't run this on the root dir of your harddrive!
	
BONUS: Turn it into a proper script. Send url and output file 
path as arguments to script. Exit with a friendly usage text if user supplies
wrong number of arguments. Also, write unit tests for each step along
the way :)
